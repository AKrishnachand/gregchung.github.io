<h4>Computation-Ready, Experimental Metal-Organic Frameworks Database</h4>
<p>
High-throughput computational screening of metal-organic frameworks rely on the availability of <b><i> disorder-free </i></b>atomic coordinate files which can be used as input to simulation software packages. Our group currently maintains the CoRE MOF database and continues to collect, curate, and analyze this unique class of material.
