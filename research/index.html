<h4><a href="http://gregchung.github.io/CoRE-MOFs/">Computation-Ready, Experimental Metal-Organic Frameworks Database</a></h4>

Our group collects, curates, and disseminates a class of nanoporous materials called metal-organic frameworks reported in the literature.

<li><h3>Carbon Capture and Utilization</h3></li>

Our group uses a multi-scale approach to find suitable technology to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from coal-fired power plants. We also investigates chemical mechanism
to turn captured CO<sub>2</sub> into useful chemical products, such as cyclic carbonates. For this latter part, our group is collaborating with Prof. Park's group at Pusan National.
