Our group investigates nanoporous materials (metal-organic frameworks, zeolites, covalent-organic frameworks, etc) for their utility in industrially important chemical separations and catalysis using modern tools of molecular simulation and data science. 

Research Areas
- Gas storage, separation, and catalysis
- Molecular thermodynamics
- Molecular simulation (Molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo)
- Material design and informatics
